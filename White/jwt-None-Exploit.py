'''Then you would create a generic verification method to compare what you get from the JWT with the signature you are generating (based on the algorithm in the header).

Since you don't generate any signature with the None algorithm, you will ensure that the signature is empty.

Therefore, as an attacker, you need to provide an empty signature.
